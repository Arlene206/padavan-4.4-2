## Current repository state

- Maintained fork: `Arlene206/padavan-4.4-2`; work only on this repository.
- Branch inventory at the latest takeover: `main` only, no remote checkpoint branch. No force-pushes are used.
- **Last fully reconciled main SHA:** `c5ec0e4c0d33e53f784a06763d479cddbc35dcbd`. AI handoff docs [42747120963] and HTTPD authentication/disclosure policy [42747121115] both completed SUCCESS on this exact SHA; the HTTPD job's host regressions and semantic source checks were green.
- **Current development slice:** make FTP `MDTM` and `SITE CHMOD` descriptor-relative after ACL resolution. Both handlers now obtain a pinned regular-file descriptor through `asus_open_existing_path()`; MDTM reads metadata with `fstat` and writes timestamps with `futimes(fd)`; CHMOD applies `fchmod(fd)`. New recoverable sysutil wrappers preserve FTP error responses instead of terminating the process. A host regression pins an existing file, renames its directory entry, creates a replacement at the same name, and verifies descriptor metadata operations affect only the original inode. The VSFTPD GNU89 and semantic Actions are pending on THIS COMMIT.
- **Known open issue:** upload failure cleanup still has a check-then-`unlinkat` window after inode identity validation. The existing regression catches replacement before validation, not the inter-operation race. Do not describe it as atomically solved. Audit Linux 4.4 capabilities and design a fail-closed bounded cleanup change separately.
- **Next after exact-head reconciliation:** inspect and address the upload cleanup race. Then resume the global P2 queue with FULLCONENAT target kernel/MIPS object validation, NFS compatibility and idempotent wireless bridge membership. PPP/IPv6 callback lifecycle and all L3/L4 device validation remain visible.
- Root `dev_log.md` contains 107 complete newest-first records and remains below the 119-record / 384 KiB early-rotation thresholds; no archive rotation is due.
- L3 production RC/MIPS/uClibc objects, firmware/TRX and L4 physical-router validation remain NOT VERIFIED.

## Completed DHCP callback and BusyBox event-state review

- The previously unfinished DHCP callback source-contract correction is reconciled on exact SHA `6b44e023c2f669865fc8b5cb5425d824b8335d8b`: the GNU89 interface transaction regression and callback source-order contract passed [42703609156]; the handoff contract passed [42703609087].
- Completed a bounded review of BusyBox `udhcp_run_script()` dispatch and callers for initial `leasefail`, accepted NAK, lease expiry, renew/repeated renew, SIGUSR2 and release-on-quit.
- The applet deliberately ignores `spawn_and_wait()` callback status. Inspected transitions invoke deconfig for lease expiry and release paths; a matching NAK deconfigures only a previously bound state, not the initial REQUESTING state. Retry exhaustion routes to `leasefail`; SIGUSR2/release-on-quit use the release path. No reproducible BusyBox protocol-state defect was established, so no behavior-changing BusyBox patch was justified.
- Follow-up finding and fix in THIS commit: `udhcpc_viptv_bound()` discarded address ioctl and old/new route operation results, then replaced the prior `manv_*` route inventory even when old-route cleanup failed. The IPTV `deconfig` dispatch also cleared gateway and route source fields regardless of teardown results. The callback now applies/rolls back the address through the existing WAN interface transaction policy, deletes old routes before publishing new lease state, restores the previous address and retains route inventory when teardown fails, reports new route setup failures, and preserves deconfig route inventory unless cleanup succeeds. BusyBox's deliberate disregard of DHCP script exit status remains unchanged; callback logs and retained NVRAM route inventory are the observable recovery evidence. Static-IP IPTV startup and ZeroConf callback operations remain outside this bounded change.

## Completed FULLCONENAT namespace / zone work

- IPv4/IPv6 mapping entries and pending dying-tuple records retain the owning struct net pointer plus conntrack zone identity (id, flags and direction).
- Mapping lookup and tuple garbage collection are scoped by the full identity. Conntrack lookups reconstruct the saved zone; final per-net target teardown unregisters the notifier, waits for legacy RCU callback readers, purges only that namespace's mapping/queue entries, then drops the conntrack namespace reference.
- The GNU89 host policy regression covers same/different namespace, zone ID, flags, direction and null inputs. It passed exact-head runs [42674430844], [42677259891], [42677876443] and [42678293858]. The notifier/cleanup lifecycle contract also passed all four runs.
- Three IPv4 helper call sites now pass &context; five identical version-conditional declaration wrappers were removed so the semantic function-body extractor can parse the refactored functions.
- The exact-head semantic contract progressed through mapping structures, namespace/zone lookup filters, IPv4/IPv6 lookup paths and conditional notifier callback signatures. FULLCONENAT lifecycle regression [42678875089] and AI handoff docs [42678875391] passed on exact SHA `bc99b6801c44f55e13dc0214336408f712e0abf8`; subsequent WAN DHCP work did not modify the kernel code.
- Kernel translation-unit compilation remains unverified; the host policy test and semantic source contract do not replace a target kernel object build.

## Completed FTP upload path anchoring (bounded first slice)

- Finding: upload ACL resolution canonicalized the target with `realpath()`, but `str_create()` / `str_create_exclusive()` reopened the original pathname. A final or parent symlink could be substituted between authorization and open, redirecting the write after the ACL decision.
- Fix: `ftp_acl_path_resolve_write_entry()` resolves the effective target and returns canonical parent plus leaf; `ftp_acl_path_open_directory()` walks absolute canonical components using `openat(O_PATH|O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC)`; `asus_open_upload_path()` checks ACLs, compares pre-open `stat()` identity with the pinned descriptor's `fstat()`, and opens the leaf with `openat(O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC)`. Existing final-symlink writes still target their canonical destination; dangling links and metadata targets remain rejected.
- Failed-upload cleanup uses the retained directory descriptor and compares the open file's device/inode against `fstatat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)` before `unlinkat()`. This detects a replacement already present at check time, but the final check/unlink pair is not atomic against a concurrent writer in that same directory on Linux 4.4; cleanup remains best-effort. Cleanup through a final symlink alias is deliberately disabled rather than unlinking the resolved target.
- Regression tests exercise parent-path replacement by a cross-share symlink, final-leaf `O_NOFOLLOW`, canonical target resolution, dangling-link rejection and replacement-inode cleanup. The host compile/run step passed in run [42713615415] on `ac75a8ff43fca3672b44605a2974a0497ecd1c0d`; its static-contract step exposed a stale hard-coded count and was corrected in THIS COMMIT.
- L3 MIPS/uClibc production-object validation and L4 device behavior remain NOT VERIFIED.

## Completed FTP work

- Existing RNFR/RNTO fix: absolute source-path pinning plus source-delete/destination-write ACL revalidation against canonical parents.
- Path-aware checks now cover STOR/APPE/STOU, RETR, MKD/RMD/DELE, LIST/NLST/STAT, SIZE, MDTM and SITE CHMOD. Upload/RETR/metadata operations authorize the effective existing symlink target; MKD/RMD/DELE authorize the entry parent; listings authorize the actual opened directory before transfer setup.
- Added fail-closed handling for dangling final upload symlinks and canonical resolution of symlinked parent directories.
- Sidecar disclosure finding: `trunk/user/libdisk/src/disk_share.c` creates `.__folder_list.txt` and `.__<account>_var.txt` under the USB mount root. Per-share READ ACLs do not govern MOUNT_LAYER, so direct FTP file commands could expose folder/account ACL metadata. Exact-name filtering now hides and rejects these reserved files before the chroot ACL bypass.
- Both existing-file and upload path resolvers also classify the canonical `realpath()` target. Thus a harmless-looking final symlink alias to an ACL sidecar is denied as well as the direct filename. Ordinary `.__notes.txt` user files do not match the classifier.
- GNU89 regression now covers positive/negative metadata filenames, direct sidecar denial, final symlink alias denial, cross-share symlinks, dangling links, new leaves and symlinked directories.
- The only failure on `30d64c73546db236c12679d24eda74c1ea9f2916` is the CI Python variable-order defect described above; host binaries themselves all passed. The workflow correction moves all helper-body extraction before assertions.

## Completed Samba paired passdb/config publication hardening

- Finding: `run_samba()` staged and renamed the private passdb, then atomically published `/etc/smb.conf`. Ordinary errors restored the passdb, but abrupt termination between the two renames could leave a new passdb paired with old configuration and no same-boot recovery path.
- Fix: added `samba_config_transaction.h` and a paired transaction journal under `/etc/samba/.config-transaction`. PREPARED records both original-file snapshots before either live file changes; recovery restores both idempotently. COMMITTED records the new pair as authoritative and makes snapshot cleanup retryable. This is explicitly a same-boot process-crash journal in volatile `/etc`, not a power-loss durability guarantee.
- A shared process-scoped lock at `/var/run/samba-config.lock` serializes `run_samba()`, public `write_smb_conf()`, and WINS-only `start_wins()`. Every writer recovers an interrupted pair before modifying configuration. `run_samba()` keeps the lock through publication and daemon postcondition checks; rollback is attempted before releasing it on an uncommitted failure.
- Added GNU89 host regression coverage for interruption after passdb rename, interruption after both renames but before COMMITTED, committed-pair cleanup, first-time passdb creation rollback, retry after partial rollback, and symlink-target rejection.
- Changed source/test paths: `trunk/user/rc/src/services_stor.c`, `trunk/user/rc/src/services_ex.c`, `trunk/user/rc/src/samba_config_transaction.h`, `trunk/user/rc/src/tests/samba_config_transaction.c`, `trunk/user/rc/src/samba_passdb_policy.h`; updated `.github/workflows/samba-share-stability.yml` and dependent `.github/workflows/httpd-security.yml` static contracts.
- Exact successful Samba host/source regression: [42708213921] on `e9a93eb84ac9f95447150869fab7e0ae1c2da9ff`. Exact successful dependent HTTPD suite: [42708503436] on `258532a78922549698bc6d9b869c7777f8f4ac05`. No full target build or router test is claimed.

## Completed FTP descriptor-relative DELE/RMD (bounded mutation slice)

- Finding: DELE and RMD authorized the canonical parent through `asus_check_permission_path()`, then called `str_unlink(path)` / `str_rmdir(path)`. Replacing a parent component after ACL approval could redirect the mutation to another share.
- Fix: `asus_remove_path()` resolves and pins the canonical parent directory, performs the existing per-share DELETE ACL check while holding the directory descriptor, revalidates the canonical path against the pinned device/inode, then calls `unlinkat()` relative to that descriptor.
- Semantics: DELE uses no `unlinkat` flags and removes the final symlink entry itself; RMD uses `AT_REMOVEDIR` and refuses a final symlink rather than following its target. Reserved metadata leaf names are rejected. DELE trailing-slash behavior remains rejected as `ENOTDIR`.
- Regression: host policy tests cover symlink-entry deletion without deleting its target, RMD refusing a symlink to a directory, successful empty-directory removal, reserved metadata denial, and parent path identity mismatch after a symlink substitution. GNU89 host policy/source-contract and AI docs completed SUCCESS on exact SHA `05c7a13f44e64b4ba81f4af34b1000bb8eb4792e` (VSFTPD [42721783706], docs [42721783725]).
- Remaining FTP work: descriptor-relative MKD, RNFR/RNTO and bounded recursive LIST/NLST/STAT are complete. MDTM/SITE CHMOD descriptor-relative metadata review and the upload cleanup check/unlink race remain open; the latter is not atomic on Linux 4.4.

## Completed FTP descriptor-relative MKD (bounded creation slice)

- Finding: `handle_mkd()` checked WRITE permission against the canonical parent path, then invoked path-based `str_mkdir()`; a parent component could be swapped after ACL approval.
- Fix: `asus_make_directory_path()` splits the leaf, resolves and pins the canonical parent, checks WRITE ACL with the parent descriptor held, verifies the same parent device/inode after authorization, and creates via `mkdirat()`.
- Compatibility: keeps parent-directory WRITE ACL semantics, mode `0777` subject to the existing process umask, and FTP NOPERM versus FILEFAIL responses. Reserved metadata leaves remain blocked.
- Regression: host policy tests create and inspect a directory using the pinned parent fd and assert reserved metadata cannot be created. GNU89 host policy/source-contract and AI docs completed SUCCESS on exact SHA `9b6c65686ad95295fd456e074292638a6c9ccf92` (VSFTPD [42722114919], docs [42722114837]).
- RNFR/RNTO remain a separate two-path rename transaction and are not included in this slice.



## Completed DNSMasq lease-file applicability fix

- **Finding:** `prepare_dns_dhcpd()` previously validated/created `/tmp/dnsmasq.leases` before knowing whether the generated configuration would contain `dhcp-leasefile`. DNS-only and AP-mode RA-only configurations do not consume this path, but an unrelated unsafe stale path could block DNS service preparation.
- **Fix:** DHCP lease and RA feature bits are explicit; `dnsmasq_lease_file_ensure()` runs only when the finalized DHCP feature flags require the lease database, immediately before emitting `dhcp-leasefile`. On error, the staged config is closed/discarded and the original error returned. Lease-using DHCP remains fail-closed.
- **Regression:** GNU89 host tests cover no-feature, RA-only, lease-using and combined feature flags. HTTPD generated-file contract asserts the gate, source ordering and staged-config cleanup.
- **Exact-head validation:** commit `e1f27e5a5fb607a6ca8177c6cf1f220dc3515e7e`: HTTPD/DNSMasq generated trust-boundary regression [42735569321] SUCCESS (including the GNU89 test binary and full source semantic contract); AI handoff docs [42735569423] SUCCESS; Samba config regression [42735569085] SUCCESS. All three runs used this exact SHA.
- **Limit:** no local checkout was available for independent test execution; no production RC/MIPS/uClibc or L4 router validation is claimed.

## Active task

1. **FTP MDTM / SITE CHMOD descriptor-relative metadata slice.** Keep `vsf_access_check_file()` deny-file filtering, then resolve share ACLs and pin the existing regular file with `asus_open_existing_path()`. MDTM now fstats the pinned descriptor and changes timestamps with `vsf_sysutil_setmodtime_fd()`; SITE CHMOD changes mode with recoverable `vsf_sysutil_fchmod_ret()`. The handlers no longer authorize one pathname and mutate a separately re-resolved path.
2. **Host regression:** the VSFTPD path-policy binary now pins a file through `ftp_acl_path_open_existing_file()`, renames that entry, creates a replacement at the original leaf, and verifies descriptor-based mode/mtime changes stay with the original inode. Workflow semantic assertions cover both handler call paths and sysutil declarations/implementations.
3. **Validation pending:** run `.github/workflows/vsftpd-stability.yml` and AI handoff docs against the exact resulting `main` SHA. The base c5 SHA's docs and HTTPD Actions are green; do not count them as validation for this commit.
4. **Next bounded task:** audit `asus_cleanup_failed_upload()` / `ftp_acl_path_unlink_opened_entry()`. The current inode comparison protects against replacement before validation but cannot close the race between `fstatat()` and `unlinkat()`. Check Linux 4.4 renameat2/syscall and uClibc availability before choosing an atomic quarantine or fail-closed fallback. Keep the race open until proven.
5. Keep FULLCONENAT target kernel/MIPS object validation, NFS compatibility, bridge membership idempotency, PPP/IPv6 callback lifecycle and L3/L4 validation in the global queue.

## Verification boundary

| Level | Status |
|---|---|
| L1 source review | PASS for MDTM descriptor-relative ACL/open/fstat/futimes ordering; PASS for SITE CHMOD descriptor-relative ACL/open/fchmod ordering; PASS for recoverable syscall error paths and inode-replacement regression design. Upload cleanup still has an unresolved check/unlink race. |
| L2 host / Actions | Base SHA `c5ec0e4c0d33e53f784a06763d479cddbc35dcbd`: AI handoff docs [42747120963] and HTTPD security [42747121115] SUCCESS. VSFTPD workflow on `07ba33d7ffd92dbaee037ca35d4f20f051070153`: GNU89 host binary passed (including pinned-inode replacement regression); Python source contract stopped on a formatting-sensitive expectation for the new two-line MDTM `futimes` call. The workflow assertion is corrected in THIS FOLLOW-UP; re-run exact-head checks are pending. |
| L3 production RC/MIPS/uClibc/firmware builds | NOT VERIFIED. |
| L4 physical router behavior | NOT VERIFIED. |
## Exact first action for the next GPT

1. Fetch live `main` and inspect all Actions tied to its exact SHA. Confirm the VSFTPD source-contract rerun succeeds after the formatting-independent assertion, and confirm AI handoff docs; inspect all failure logs.
2. If green, investigate `ftp_acl_path_unlink_opened_entry()` and prove Linux 4.4 / target MIPS-uClibc support before changing the check-then-`unlinkat` cleanup window. No atomicity claim until the replacement race is closed by a supported mechanism or cleanup fails closed.
3. Keep FULLCONENAT target MIPS compilation, NFS compatibility, bridge membership idempotency, PPP/IPv6 callback lifecycle, and L3/L4 validation visible.

## Continuation rules

- `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` is the sole actionable continuation point; update only when resumable work/checkpoint/next action materially changes.
- Update `REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md` only when module status/evidence/priorities materially change.
- Root `dev_log.md` keeps 20–119 complete records newest first; at 120, archive the oldest 100 verbatim and retain newest 20. Use 384 KiB as early-rotation target and 512 KiB as hard limit.
- Preserve archive snapshots/indexes byte-for-byte; do not add routine archive snapshots or docs-only commits.
- Run `scripts/check_ai_handoff_docs.py` only with a full local checkout; exact-head Actions are authoritative for the pushed SHA.
- Recheck live `main`, branches and exact-head Actions on every takeover. Never force-push. Do not claim target builds or device tests without evidence.
